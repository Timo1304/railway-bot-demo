# ⚡ Discord Live-Stream — Low-Latency Support Observer

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>A forensic observability pipeline that bridges internal Ops (Discord) with external visibility (Web).</strong></p>
</blockquote>

This project is <strong>not a chat bot</strong>.<br />
It is a <strong>real-time event ingestion and observability system</strong> designed to demonstrate disciplined
full-stack engineering and production-aware trade-offs.

It solves a classic Support problem:

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“How do we observe the support queue in real time without being logged into the admin platform?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>

## 🧭 What This System Does

- Listens to live Discord events via the Gateway  
- Sanitizes and persists messages into a durable store  
- Broadcasts updates to a web client in real time  
- Retains history even if the ingestion service crashes  

<strong>The result:</strong> a live, read-only support stream accessible from the web, with zero refresh and no admin access required.

🧱 The Stack (The “Railway Standard”)
Ingestion (The Ear)

Node.js + Discord.js (Gateway Intents)

Running as a persistent Worker

State & Sync (The Brain)

Supabase

PostgreSQL for persistence

Realtime engine for fan-out

Presentation (The Face)

Next.js 16 (App Router)

Tailwind CSS

Infrastructure

Monorepo deployed on Railway

🧠 Engineering Decisions & Trade-offs

This system is built with failure in mind.

1. Persistence Layer — Why Supabase?

<strong>Decision:</strong> Supabase instead of direct Bot ➜ Client WebSockets

<strong>Why:</strong>

Full decoupling between ingestion and presentation

No data loss if the worker crashes or restarts

Enables history hydration + live updates from a single source of truth

A direct socket would drop all state the moment the worker dies.

---
2. Execution Model — Why a Worker?

<strong>Decision:</strong> Dedicated background Worker instead of a Next.js API route

<strong>Why:</strong>

Discord bots require a persistent heartbeat

Serverless functions are ephemeral by design

Running a bot inside API routes causes zombie processes and rate-limit failures

The worker runs independently of web traffic and deployment cycles.

---
3. Idempotency — Solving the “Duplicate Event” Problem

<strong>Decision:</strong> UPSERT using discord_message_id as the primary key

<strong>Why:</strong>

Network retries and gateway reconnects happen

Packet replays must not create duplicate records

Processing the same event twice always results in <strong>one database row</strong>.

---
🐛 Production Considerations (Forensic Audit)

If this were deployed for enterprise support teams, the next hardening steps would be:

Security (RLS)

Currently public for demo speed.
Production would gate access via Discord OAuth + role checks.

Backfill Logic

Messages sent while the worker is offline are currently missed.<br />
A production version would fetch channel history on boot to close gaps.

Latency

Discord ➜ Bot ➜ DB ➜ Client adds a small hop.<br />
For support observability, sub-100ms latency is acceptable and predictable.

🚀 Local Setup (Forensic Mode)
Prerequisites

Node.js v18+

Supabase project

Discord bot token

---
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/railway-forensic-bot.git
</br>
cd railway-forensic-bot
</br>
npm install
---
Environment Configuration

Create a .env file from .env.example:
# Discord
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here

# Supabase
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

---
Dual-Process Startup (By Design)

Because the system is decoupled, <strong>two processes must run simultaneously</strong>.

<strong>Terminal 1 — Web Interface</strong>

npm run dev
---
<strong>Terminal 2 — Ingestion Worker</strong>

npx tsx src/bot/index.ts

Verification

Open http://localhost:3000

Send a message in your Discord server

Watch it appear instantly in the web UI — no refresh required

🧩 Why This Project Exists

This repository is a <strong>signal</strong>, not a product.

Demonstrates real-time systems thinking

Shows production-aware trade-offs

Treats support infrastructure as first-class engineering

<blockquote> <p><strong>Support is not tickets — it’s telemetry.</strong></p> </blockquote>

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system follows a <strong>Decoupled Event-Driven Architecture</strong>.<br />
The ingestion layer (Discord Worker) and presentation layer (Web) are fully independent, linked only by a real-time database.
